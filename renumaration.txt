Hey dear Stijn!

well, its difficult to say honestly, but I must say these last two
weeks I have been sick. I did half of the connection and then Matea did the other half. 
I was using apiSauce at the beginning but then I saw Matea changed it and
started using axios instead. You can also view her contribution on Github which is
mainly for connection.

Thanks,
Nasrin
