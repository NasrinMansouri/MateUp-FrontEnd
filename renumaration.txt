Hey dear Stijn!

well, its difficult to say honestly, but I must say this last two
weeks I have been sick. I did half of the connection and then Matea was suppose
to do the other half. I was using apiSauce at the begining but then I saw Matea
start using axios instead. You can also view her contribution in github which is for
mainly for connection.
For Violeta she hasn't done anything in this project. But she has done in a seperate
one which she will share it with you I believe. And as her work is gonna be finish last
minute I did not have a time to integrate it here! 

Thanks,
Nasrin
